# ClientServer-Application
Self contained Client / Server application that supports local socket connections, command listening from client, a client GUI interface, and server returns.

This was originally built to be locally ran, then eventually updated to support a web server and database server (mySQL).

Application has been migrated to IntelliJ from NetBeans in 3/17
